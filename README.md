# 🍲 Recipe Page

This is a solution to the [Recipe Page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/recipe-page-KiTsR8QQKm). It's a beginner-level project focused on semantic HTML, layout styling, and responsive design using pure HTML and CSS.

## Overview

A clean, elegant recipe page layout built using semantic HTML and modern CSS techniques. The design showcases a recipe with a featured image, ingredients, preparation steps, and nutritional info. This challenge helped me focus on structure, spacing, responsive layout, and good typography.
